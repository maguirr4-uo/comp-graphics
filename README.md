# comp-graphics
A software-based computer graphics system that renders imagery via rasterization, including Phong shading, hidden surface removal, and arbitrary camera positions.

I worked in this project throughout the second quarter of 2021 to get an idea about how graphics systems like OpenGL work with the graphics card to generate images on a computer screen.

For this program to work, it requires VTK. It can be found at https://vtk.org/
